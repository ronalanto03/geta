Hello, after reading over your job posting this looks like a perfect fit for my skills set.
My name is Ronald, i am a systems engineer and software developer.
I am autodidact, skilled to reproduce problems and find a way to solve them. 

I write code with good style and good documentation.
I am always willing to learn(i really like it) and share my knowledge.
I have good knowledge of  java.
I have used git and svn for version control.
I have strong knowledge of c, c++, data structures, multithreading(just in case it is needed in the future).

I like to be honest and keep things clear: I come from a world of low level programming languages but i am a good systems engineer and a quick learner.

Iâ€™m looking for new experiences that lead me to new knowledge and for long-term working relationships.

I would like to know more about this role.


Thank you and i look forward to the opportunity to work with you.

PS: My CV is attached(Just in case you want to check it out).

Best regards,
Ronald Sulbaran


I have basic knowledge of MySQL and hibernate. And i have used JSON while developing some REST APIs in RoR


I come from low level programming languages, so my most relevant work is in that field:

Software developer at Accelogic: Implementation of MPI prototypes to improve the execution time in c, c++ and fortran. Research for methods to improve parallel applications, like compression of data in memory
and compression for communication. Administration of HPC clusters using bash scripting on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Penguin Computing and beowulf clusters. 


Well, i really enjoyed the first time i used hibernate, before that i used a third-party library(driver) to manage a DB and it was a complete nightmare. The ORM approach is much better to understand and use.
